# CrewAI GameDevs Optimization Plan

## Overview
This TODO list addresses the gaps between the current CrewAI setup and the recommendations outlined in "Optimized CrewAI Setup.md" to achieve a professional, efficient game design document generation workflow.

## Current Status Analysis
✅ **Strengths of Current Setup:**
- All 4 recommended agents are properly defined (pitch_writer, gameplay_designer, technical_architect, chief_editor)
- Task sequence with proper context chaining is implemented
- GDD template tools are available and integrated
- YAML configuration is properly structured
- LLM configuration uses appropriate temperatures for different agents
- Sequential process and memory are enabled
- Markdown formatting is configured

❌ **Areas Requiring Improvement:**
- Agent delegation is limited (only chief_editor has delegation enabled)
- Input variables and runtime configuration need enhancement
- No human review or feedback loops implemented
- Output file organization needs improvement
- Missing template structure validation
- No scope management or constraint checking
- Error handling and validation are minimal
- Advanced CrewAI features (planning) are not utilized

## Implementation Priority
The tasks are organized with dependencies to ensure a logical implementation flow:

1. **Foundation Tasks** (Can be done in parallel):
   - Enable agent delegation
   - Implement input variables
   - Enhance template tools
   - Improve output organization

2. **Validation & Quality Tasks** (Depend on foundation):
   - Add template validation
   - Implement scope management
   - Add markdown validation
   - Enhance error handling

3. **Advanced Features** (Depend on foundation):
   - Add human review workflow
   - Implement version control
   - Explore planning capabilities

4. **Integration & Testing** (Final phase):
   - Update main.py
   - Add casual RTS example
   - Test complete workflow

## Success Metrics
- Generate a complete, professional GDD that follows the template structure
- Ensure all agents collaborate effectively with proper delegation
- Validate that the workflow produces consistent, high-quality output
- Confirm the system can handle the casual RTS example from the optimization document
- Demonstrate that the workflow is suitable for solo developer constraints (6-12 month timeline)

## Key Improvements Expected
1. **Better Collaboration**: Agents will be able to delegate and collaborate more effectively
2. **Professional Output**: Generated GDDs will follow the complete template structure
3. **Scope Management**: Technical architect will validate feasibility for solo developers
4. **Human-in-the-Loop**: Review phases will allow for feedback and iteration
5. **Error Resilience**: Better error handling and validation throughout the process
6. **Extensibility**: The system will be more modular and easier to extend for future needs

This plan transforms the current functional setup into a production-ready, professional game design document generation system that follows industry best practices and CrewAI optimization guidelines.
